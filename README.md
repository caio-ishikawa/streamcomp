Oftentimes, it is complicated to host small tournaments with your viewers. In order to conduct a simple event to rank your viewer's computer setups, you would usually create a hashtag on Twitter and have your viewers use it to submit pictures of their setup. You would then need to compile the pictures and judge them using your own system.

StreamComp makes it easy. It allows you to input the desired hashtag and the total amount of competitors, and it automatically creates a bracket with the entries from Twitter.
